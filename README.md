MOD player based on an ESP32-S3 (18MB module) and a PCM5102 DAC module.

The player is currently built around off-the-shelf modules, but contributions are welcome.
Developers interested in PCB design are especially encouraged to join the project.

At the moment, 4 channels are operational in mono on a through-hole prototype board.

Next milestone:

8-channel support

Switchable audio effects

The current pin configuration can be found at the beginning of the source code.

The project is uploadable via Arduino IDE.
Current Arduino IDE version: 2.3.7-nightly-20250712
